<p>
This graph shows the number of dwellings for which building consents have been granted. An analysis of historic data shows that 80-95% of consented dwellings are built.

The default view of this graph shows two years of data, however earlier months can be viewed by dragging from the left side of the x axis.<br>
This graph shows the number of dwellings per month for which building consents have been granted. Monthly fluctuations are expected due to seasonal changes.

<div style="max-width:1000px; padding-left: 20px;">
<p>
This graph shows the number of dwellings which have been fully constructed, based on receiving a code compliance certificate (CCC).<br>
Extra datasets can be selected to show consented dwellings, which can be compared to completed dwellings to show the approximate delay between developments being consented and constructed. It can also show projected dwellings, based on work done for Wellington City Council by Forecast.ID.

<div style="max-width:1000px; padding-left: 20px;">
<p>
This graph shows the number of dwellings for which building consents have been granted, as well as estimated population increase. This is meant to provide a rough indication of over-supply and under-supply of housing over time. 
<br>
Due to the population data available, this graph uses years from July-June rather than calendar years. As a result, values may seem different to those on other graphs on this website.
<br>
Consented housing capacity is estimated by multiplying the number of consented dwellings by the average Wellington City household size of 2.6 (as at the 2013 Census).
In addition to population growth, extra demand for dwellings will also arise from changes of household formation (e.g. the trend for smaller households).  <br>
